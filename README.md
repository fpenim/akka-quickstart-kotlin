# akka-quickstart-kotlin

Disclaimer: This kotlin project is based on the [akka-quickstart-java](https://developer.lightbend.com/guides/akka-quickstart-java/index.html) 
example project made available by [Lightbend](https://www.lightbend.com/).

Akka is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed, and fault-tolerant event-driven applications 
on the JVM.

Actors are the unit of execution in Akka. The Actor model is an abstraction that makes it easier to write correct 
concurrent, parallel and distributed systems. The Hello World example illustrates Akka basics.

## Running the application

Run this application with Maven:
```bash
$ mvn compile exec:exec
```
